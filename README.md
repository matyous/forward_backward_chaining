# forward_backward_chaining

the syntax of text files should be as follows:

first line contains the knowledge seperated by comma ',' (base de faits)
(empty line)
the lines to come contain the rules (base de regles) that should be expressed in this format:
a+b=>c means if a and b then c
(empty line)
final line containes the goals to determine (for backward chaining) for multiple goals they should be comma seperated
